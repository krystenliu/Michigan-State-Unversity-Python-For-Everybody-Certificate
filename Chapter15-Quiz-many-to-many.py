Many-to-Many Relationships and Python

Question 1:

How do we model a many-to-many relationship between two database tables?

We add 10 foreign keys to each table with names like artict_id_1, artist_id2, etc.
We add a table with two foreign keys
We use the ARRAY column type in both of the tables
We use a BLOB column in both tables

Ans: We add a table with two foreign keys

Question 2:

In Python, what is a database "cursor" most like?

A Python dictionary
A function
A file handle
A method within a class

Ans: A file handle

Question 3:

What method do you call  in an SQLIte cursor object in Python to run an SQL command?

send()
socket()
run()
execute()

Ans: execute()

Question 4:

In the following SQL,
cur.execute('SELECT count FROM Counts WHERE org = ? ', (org, ))

what is the purpose of the "?"?

It allows more than one boolean operation in the WHERE clause
It is a placeholder for the contents of the "org" variable
It is a search wildcard
It is a syntax error

Ans: It is a placeholder for the contents of the "org" variable

Question 5:

In the following Python code sequence (assuming cur is a SQLite cursor object),

cur.execute('SELECT count FROM Counts WHERE org = ? ', (org, ))
row = cur.fetchone()

what is the value in row if no rows match the WHERE clause?

None
An empty dictionary
An empty list
-1

Ans: None

Question 6:

What does the LIMIT clause in the following SQL accomplish?

SELECT org, count FROM Counts 
   ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10

It only retrieves the first 10 rows from the table
It only sorts on the first 10 characters of the column
It reverses the sort order if there are more than 10 rows
It avoids reading data from any table other than Counts

Ans: It only retrieves the first 10 rows from the table

Question 7:

What does the executescript() method in the Python SQLite cursor object do that the normal execute() method does not do?

It allows embeded Python to be executed
It allows multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons
It allows database tables to be created
It allows embedded JavaScript to be executed

Ans: It allows multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons

Question 8:

What is the purpose of "OR IGNORE" in the following SQL:

INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Course (title) VALUES ( ? )

It makes sure that if a particular title is already in the table, there are no duplicate rows inserted
It ignores errors in the SQL syntax for the statement
It updates the created_at value if the title already exists in the table
It ignores any foreign key constraint errors

Ans: It makes sure that if a particular title is already in the table, there are no duplicate rows inserted


Question 9:

Question 9
For the following Python code to work, what must be added to the title column in the CREATE TABLE statement for the Course table:

cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Course (title)
    VALUES ( ? )''', ( title, ) )
cur.execute('SELECT id FROM Course WHERE title = ? ', 
    (title, ))
course_id = cur.fetchone()[0]

An AUTOINCREMENT indication
A UNIQUE constraint
A PRIMARY KEY indication
A NOT NULL constraint

Ans: A UNIQUE constraint

continue
def

Ans: def

Question 2:

In Python, how do you indicate the end of the block of code that makes up the function?

You add a line that has at least 10 dashes
You put the colon character (:) in the first column of a line
You add the matching curly brace that was used to start the function }

Ans: You de-indent a line of code to the same indent level as the def keyword

Question 3:

A built-in function
A way to retrieve web pages over the network
A conditional statement
The central processing unit

Ans: A built-in function

Question 4:

print('There')

There

def, thing

Ans: There

Question 5:

x
max
'banana'
y

Ans: x

Question 6:

What will the following Python code print out?

    print(x)

func(10)
func(20)

10,20
def, x, func, func
x, 20
x, x

10,20

Question 7:

    return a

x = addtwo(2, 7)
print(x)

Traceback
2
7
14

Ans: 2

Question 10:

What is the most important benefit of writing your own functions?

Following the rule that no function can have more than 10 statements in it
Following the rule that whenever a program is more than 10 lines you must use a function
Avoiding writing the same non-trivial code more than once in your program
To avoid having more than 10 lines of sequential code without an indent or de-indent

Ans: Avoiding writing the same non-trivial code more than once in your program

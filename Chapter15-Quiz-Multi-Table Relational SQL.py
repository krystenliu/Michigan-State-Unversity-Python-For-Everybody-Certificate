Multi-Table Relational SQL

Question 1:

What is the primary added value of relational databases over flat files?

Ability to store data in a format that can be sent across a network
Ability to scan large amounts of data quickly
Ability to execute Python code within the file
Ability to quickly convert data to HTML
Ability to execute JavaScript in the file

Ans: Ability to scan large amounts of data quickly

Question 2:

Question 2
What is the purpose of a primary key?

To look up a particular row in a table very quickly
To look up a row based on a string that comes from winreg import QueryValue
from outside the program
To point to a particular row in another table
To track the number of duplicate values in another column

Ans: To look up a particular row in a table very quickly

Question 3:

Which of the following is NOT a good rule to follow when developing a database model?

Model each "object" in the application as one or more tables
Use integers as primary keys
Never repeat string data in more than one table in a data model
Use a person's email address as their primary key

Ans: Use a person's email address as their primary key

Question 4:

If our user interface (i.e., like iTunes) has repeated strings on one column of the user interface, how should we model this properly in a database?

Put the string in the first row where it occurs and then put NULL in all of the other rows



Put the string in the first row where it occurs and then put that row number in the column of all of the rest of the rows where the string occurs
Make a table that maps the strings in the column to numbers and then use those numbers in the column
Encode the entire row as JSON and store it in a TEXT column in the database
Put the string in the last row where it occurs and put the number of that row in the column of all of the rest of the rows where the string occurs

Ans: Make a table that maps the strings in the column to numbers and then use those numbers in the column

Question 5:

Which of the following is the label we give a column that the "outside world" uses to look up a particular row?

Foreign key
Logical key
Local key
Remote key
Primary key

Ans: Logical key

Question 6:

What is the label we give to a column that is an integer and used to point to a row in a different table?

Local key
Logical key
Primary key
Remote key
Foreign key

Ans: Foreign key

Question 7: 

What SQLite keyword is added to primary keys in a CREATE TABLE statement to indicate that the database is to provide a value for the column when records are inserted?

INSERT_AUTO_PROVIDE
AUTO_INCREMENT
ASSERT_UNIQUE
AUTOINCREMENT

Ans: AUTOINCREMENT

Question 8:

What is the SQL keyword that reconnects rows that have foreign keys with the corresponding data in the table that the foreign key points to?

APPEND
CONSTRAINT
CONNECT
JOIN
COUNT

Ans: JOIN

Question 9:

What happens when you JOIN two tables together without an ON clause?

The number of rows you get is the number of rows in the first table times the number of rows in the second table
You get no rows at all
The rows of the left table are connected to the rows in the right table when their primary key matches
Leaving out the ON clause when joining two tables in SQLite is a syntax error
You get all of the rows of the left table in the JOIN and NULLs in all of the columns of the right table

Ans: The number of rows you get is the number of rows in the first table times the number of rows in the second table

Question 10:

When you are doing a SELECT with a JOIN across multiple tables with identical column names, how do you distinguish the column names?

tablename.columnname
tablename->columnname
tablename['columnname']
tablename/columnname

Ans: tablename.columnname
